			<h1> SQR, inc. </h1>
			<p>Our goal is to create a tangible six-pack of square cans which would include our specific branding on the box as well.
				Along with the distinct square shape of the product, we also plan to differentiate ourselves from traditional cans by implementing a resealable pop tab. </p>

			<h1> Who Are We? </h1>
			<p> Have you ever questioned why canned drinks are always in a cylindrical format? So
			have we. Founded by five students at the University of Michigan, SQR Inc. aims to 
			alleviate the monotony of drinking out of a cylindrical can. Beer and seltzer drinkers
			alike can now spice up their nights by picking up a pack of SQR. With SQR's quadrilateral footprint (that still fits in traditional cup holders!), expect to be approached by endless individuals curious about the future of canned beverages. Through our modernized design process, SQR Inc. aims to always remain up-to-date on the latest drink consumption trends and technology. </p>
